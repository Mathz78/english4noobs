# Classroom English?

When we're learning and/or teaching English, there are some commands that help us to avoid using Portuguese. And those, for our daily routine, are also helpful!

-  Some examples of English Classroom Commands are:
    - How do you spell {word}?

# In use

### I could totally use an example in class, but I want to bring something closer to a daily routine. So, let's go with an introduction:

    Júlia: "Hey, nice to meet you. My name is Júlia"
    You: "Nice to meet you too. Is it Julha? How do you spell it?"
    Júlia: "It's J-U-L-I-A."
    You: "I'm sorry, I don't understand. Could you speak more slowly, please?"
    Júlia: "Sure. It's J-U-L-I-A."
